here are some usefull commands to be used in git:
- create new file: "touch filename.extension"
if the repository is configured already (see Git_GitHub_installation.txt), use the following commands to get status, update the original online repository on github according to the last changes done locally on your computer

- get status: 														git status

- add updates to git:												got add filename.extension

- commit updates:													git commit -m "COMMENTS GO HERE" filenam.extension
NOTE: the flag "-m" is to activate comment mode so you can add comment with the commit you are submiting

- push the commited updates to original repository in github.com:	git push -u origin main(or other branch names)
NOTE: you will be prompt to enter github username and password
NOTE: if you have not activated your two-factor authentication on GitHub, you will be given the link to instructions to activate it first because password authorization is no longer avaiable for git commands.  
NOTE: once 2FA is activated, you need to generate a personal access token as described here: 

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

NOTE: you need to save your token somewhere safe in a *.txt file and then use it your as password for userpass-requiring git commands; see the example in here:
